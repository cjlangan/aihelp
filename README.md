```bash
user$ aihelp
```
          
The error message you're encountering indicates that there is a syntax issue in your code at line 58.
 Specifically, the line:

```c
SDL_Surface *screenSurface == SDL_GetWindowSurface(window);
```

is incorrect because you are using the equality operator == instead of the assignment operator =.
 The correct syntax for declaring and initializing a variable in C should use a single =. 

Hereâ€™s how you can fix it:

Change the line from:

```c
SDL_Surface *screenSurface == SDL_GetWindowSurface(window);
```

to:

```c
SDL_Surface *screenSurface = SDL_GetWindowSurface(window);
```

This change uses the assignment operator = to assign the result of SDL_GetWindowSurface(window) to
 the pointer screenSurface.

After making this change, try compiling your code again with the make command. If there are no other
 errors, it should compile successfully.
